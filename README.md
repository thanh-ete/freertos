# STM32 - FreeRTOS - CubeIDE

Today in this tutorial, I am going to walk you through a very important part of an embedded system. Yes, that is deploying a RTOS into the microcontroller.

RTOS stands for Real Time Operating System. And as the name suggests, it is capable of doing tasks, as an operating system does. The main purpose of an OS is to have the functionality, where we can use multiple tasks at the same time. Which obviously isn’t possible with bare metal.

## The tutorial is the first in the series of many and will cover the following

1. Setting up FreeRTOS using CubeIDE
2. Benefit of using a RTOS
3. Creating tasks with or without CubeIDE
4. Using priorities to sort out some common problems
